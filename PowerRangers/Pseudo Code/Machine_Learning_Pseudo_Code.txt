First time

Create a Config file

Get the date and time 

Generate the AC combinations for no of AC input

Iterate through combinations
	Switch on th ACs for a particular combination
        keep measuring the temperature until there is not much temperature  change for a period of time
	record the lowest temperature attained to config file with date, and combination

======================================

Run this code twice in a month

The next time it runs , 
read the existing config file
get the date and time
Get the AC combination from the file
	switch on AC for the particular combination
        keep measuring the temperature until there is not much temperature  change for a period of time
	record the lowest temperature attained to config file with date, and combination along side the existing data
 

======================================
Keep doing this to get a data over over the year.
After a year is over, if the execution time is near one of previous execution day of month,
	get the current data and previous data, 
	average the data (find expectation)
	update the data with averaged data for the particular day of month
 
======================================
This data can be used along with Occupancy detail to implement Zone based cooling easily
